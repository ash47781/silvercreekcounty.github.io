        <p>Overall Rules</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>1: Be respectful to everyone, no racism, hate speech, no sexual harrassment, no discrimination, etc of any kind. This offense can result in straight Ban (#4) without warnings.</p>
    
        <p>2: No Metagaming (meta). This includes OOC calls, DMs, or voice chats. Chilling in the Saloon etc is allowed but during RP scenes you are required to Mute and Deafen in the call until the scene is complete.</p>
    
        <p>3: To attach to the above rule, there are certain channels in Disc that are for RP purposes, the messages and bulletins sent by citizens will be viewed as public knowledge to all, while anything outside of those chats will stay private.</p>

        <p>4: When the server is 10 mins from restart (alerts will show) ALL RP ENDS until after restart</p>

        <p>5: When Failed Role Play (FRP) is called, all persons involved will be required to join a discord call with the staff member(s) that issued the FRP.</p>

        <p>6: Donations are just that, DONATIONS. If a donation is for an item such as a house or a wagon or a horse, we will do our absolute best to put in the requested item, OR a valued substitute. Items will be put in and tested by the Owners before money is exchanged and you are satisfied.</p>

        <p>7: Donated items may be resold IN COUNTY ONLY, for example, if you are selling a 1of1 weapon, you can sell it for however much you want in the County. Absolutely no out of city money exchanges for any items or jobs.</p>






        <p>Character Rules</p>

        
        <p>Character names must be realistic. No sexual puns or political names, and no extremely bad person names. (no Hitler)</p>

        <p>After a death and you respawn in the hospital, you must forget the last 30 mins of character activity. If picked up or revived by Dr on scene, you may remember all activities. </p>

        <p>Must adhere to Fear Factor: ex, if a gun is pulled point blank like a robbery, you must have the mindset of preserving life. This applies for citizen vs citizen and cop vs citizen</p>

        <p>No bank camping, this does not include going to rob a bank and running into a citizen and robbing them in scene.</p>

        <p>No killing hostages that have complied with demands / instructions.</p>

        <p>No forcing PermaDeath on any characters, meaning someone is forcing you to kill your character off and make a new one. Both parties must agree if you’d like to go out this way.</p> 

        <p>If you PermaDeath a character, there is NO reincarnation, and the new persona must be different with no memories of the past. (no friends in county, no grudges, etc) You must convey this message to an Admin, and you will be brought to the hospital (dead or alive) for your “Time of death”.</p>

        <p>Unconscious / dead players must be dropped off at a location easily accessible to Drs or at a Hospital. If players involved all die, and no access is available, you must respawn at the hospital. Must forget the last 30 mins.</p>

        <p>No “F8 quitting” “leaving county” during an active RP scene, (Law stops you, you’re getting robbed). The one exception to this rule is if a glitch or other event happens you may restart the game but you MUST treat it like no time has passed and continue the scene.</p>

        <p>No forced sexual scenarios, this will be an immediate CFX (RedM) Ban per their TOS.</p>

        <p>After PVP robberies, there is a 30 min cool down before another robbery can take place.</p>

        <p>All houses are considered Private Property, and shall be defended with force when an unknown party is on site.</p>

        <p>Horse and Carrage Rules</p>

        <p>ABSOLUTELY NO RDM, HDM (horse death match): all deaths must be in some form of RP with the victim.</p>

        <p>This includes running people over with horses or with horse and buggy. Accidents happen, but no intentional deaths.</p>

        <p>Emergency Services Rules</p>

        <p>When only 1 Law is on, no killing of the officer is allowed. Shootouts with said officer are allowed (shooting horse, shooting around them) but no body shots that will kill.</p>

        <p>As of right now, no killing Doctors AT ALL while on duty.</p>
